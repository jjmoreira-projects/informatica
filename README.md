### Open a user session


Require the sessionmangement script

`var sessionMgt = require("informatica/sessionmanagement.js");`

Create an instance of SessionManager

`var sessionMgr = new sessionMgt.SessionManager();`

**Note** You can pass credentials ({username:"some_username", password:"some_password") to the construction of SessionManager. If you don't, the instace falls back to the username and password defined in the config file.

Open a session

`var user = sessionMgr.openSession();`

**Note** You can pass true to the openSession method to force the creation of a new session.

### List tasks (jobs)

Require the taskmanagement script

`var taskMgt = require("informatica/taskmanagement.js");`

Create an instance of TaskManager

`var taskMgr = new taskMgt.TaskManager(user.getSessionManager());`

List tasks of a given type

`var tasks = taskMgr.listTasks({type:"DSS"});`

**Note** If you do not specify the task type, the taskManager uses the default task type defined in the config file.
